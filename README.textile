h1. Jenkins Pre Build Plugin

This plugin allows to build a project before the current project.

It supports to build the upstream project only when its source changed (poll scm).

If wanted the build waits until the upstream build is finished.
In this case the current build executor is blocked until the upstream project finished building.
